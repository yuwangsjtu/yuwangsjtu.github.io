Yu Wang is an Associate Professor at Cooperative Medianet Incorporative Center (CMIC), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univserity (SJTU). Prior to SJTU, he was a Senior Research Associate working in the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) of CUED at University of Cambridge. He was working with [Prof. Mark Gales](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mjfg/), [Prof. Phil Woodland](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~pcw/) and [Dr. Kate Knill](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~kmk/). He obtained his PhD study in Speech Processing in the [Speech and Audio Processing Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/speech-audio-processing) at Imperial College London, supervised by [Mike Brookes](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/dmb.html). Following his graduation of PhD, he joined University of Cambridge as a Research Associate and started to work as a key member on the [Automated Language Teaching and Assessment (ALTA) project](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/) (funded by [Cambridge Assessment](https://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/)). We publised an end-to-end deep learning-based automatic spoken language assessment platform [Speak&Improve](https://speakandimprove.com/) in 2019 and it is now offcially suggested as the practising platform for Cambridge Linguskill international English test. Since 2019, he started to work on the [Machine Translation for English Retrieval of Information in Any Language (MATERIAL) project](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/material) (funded by IARPA), on which he was the technical lead for the spoken language processing contribution at CUED. His current research interests focus on Natural Language Processing, Multi-modal Dialogue System and Large Langage Model.
